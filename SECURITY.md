## Security Best Practices

To ensure the security of your interactions with our platform, we recommend the following:

### For Users:
- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Always enable 2FA on your account to protect against unauthorized access.

- **Stay Informed:** Regularly update your wallet and other software to the latest versions.
- **Be Cautious with Links:** Only interact with official Block Fund links and be wary of phishing attempts.

### For Developers:
- **Code Reviews:** All code changes must undergo thorough peer reviews. Use tools like linters and static analyzers to catch potential vulnerabilities.
- **Smart Contract Audits:** Before deploying any smart contract, ensure it has been audited by a trusted third-party security firm.
- **Access Control:** Implement least privilege principles for accessing sensitive data and contract functions.
- **Regular Updates:** Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date with the latest security patches.

## Smart Contract Security

### Key Security Practices:
- **Reentrancy Guards:** Use checks-effects-interactions patterns to prevent reentrancy attacks.
- **Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs to prevent unexpected behaviors or malicious inputs.
- **Gas Limit Management:** Ensure contracts are optimized for gas efficiency and cannot be exploited by consuming excessive gas.
- **Upgradeability:** If contracts are upgradeable, ensure that the upgrade mechanisms are secure and properly managed.
